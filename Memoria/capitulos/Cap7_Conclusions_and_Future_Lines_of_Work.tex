\chapter{Conclusions and Future Lines of Work} \label{chap:Conclusions} 


This chapter will present the conclusions reached after the completion of this work and discuss possible future lines of work.
The conclusions and results obtained from this research and development project can be summarised in the following points:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A first added value of the work done has been the contextualisation and learning carried out by the student in the field of high performance computing. Given the scarcity of subjects related to this topic in the Degree in Computer Science at the Universidad of La Laguna, the student has initially had to make a significant effort in learning concepts and techniques that were alien to him.
    
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item Implementation and benchmarking for different back-ends and/or target hardware using SYCL. Due to limitations in terms of available hardware, the only platforms that have been experimented with are CPU and GPU. It would be interesting to extend the experiments to other platforms.
 \end{enumerate}
